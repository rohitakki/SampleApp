# NewsApp
### Here is the completed assignment on *news_app* branch

### I have used Kotlin for the complete project

Just to mention I was about to add pagination but NewsAPI sdk does not allow to fetch more than 100 results for developer accounts so i couldnâ€™t apply pagination.

### Here is the demo video: [DEMO VIDEO](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lY0UDc0C9ZbEZmRc7GNgKbj8V3b-R1Be/view?usp=sharing)

Major libraries used

- Hilt - Dagger for dependency injection
- SwipeRefreshLayout library for Swipe to refresh view
